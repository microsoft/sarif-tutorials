# Appendix: Resources

- The [SARIF Home Page](http://sarifweb.azurewebsites.net/) might be the only resource you need.
It has links to the spec, these tutorials, tools and libraries,
viewer extensions for various environments,
and even an online validator that in which you can a SARIF file and find out
if it conforms to the spec.<sup><a href="#note-7">7</a></sup>

## Notes

<a id="note-1"></a>1. The validator ensures that the file conforms to the SARIF schema, and also evaluates about
a dozen checks for constraints that are present in the spec but not expressed in the schema.
The spec has hundreds of such requirements ("**SHALL**" statements) and recommendations ("**SHOULD**" statements),
so there's plenty of room to improve the validator.
